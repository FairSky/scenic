# Name: Scroll View Mouse Adjust

## Description

Buttons are placed in a scroll view. Mouse overs the buttons should be
displayed with adjusted coordinates (the coordinates should be larger
because of the scroll view offsets).

For instance, if a button with width 100 and height 100 is placed at
coordinates (0,0) relative to the scroll view, but the scroll view has
a horizontal offset of 50, then the button will be displayed at (-50,
0). Furthermore, clicks at (0,0) must be sent to the button as clicks
at (50, 0) because the button is unaware that it is displayed 50
pixels to the left (in other words, the presence of the scroll view is
transparent to the button). This adjustment of mouse coordinates is
verified by this test.

## Test Sequence

Move the mouse over the visible parts of the buttons.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Check that the mouse events have coordinates that are larger than the
mouse coordinates relative to the upper left corners of the
scene. They should be larger because `scenic` adjusts the mouse event
coordinates to account for the scroll view offsets.

The test sets the scroll view to have a horizontal offset of 50 and a
vertical offset of 60, so the mouse coordinates should be larger by 50
pixels (x coordinate) and respectively 60 pixels (y coordinate).
