# Name: Henchman-1

## Description

Test the 'henchman' container, which arranges its children rather
mindlessly, but according to orders (which it doesn't discuss).

## Test Sequence

Run the test.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

You must see four colored squares (red in the upper left corner, green
in the lower left corner, blue in the upper right corner and
magentaish in the lower right corner).

They should be ten pixels away from the edges of the scene.
