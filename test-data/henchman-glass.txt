# Name: Henchman-Glass

## Description

Some squares placed in glass widgets are overlapped using a henchman
container.

## Test Sequence

Run the test.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

The squares should look pale and their colors must combine (because of
the non 1.0 opacity of their glass containers). The corners of the
combined squares must display the uncombined colors.
