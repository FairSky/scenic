# Name: Add Task

## Description

A system of tasks is used to execute UI code on the UI thread (so we
don't need to bother making all the scenic code thread safe). Since
tasks can be added from other threads, they can be added in various
orders. To make sure the test is replayed in the same order, 1) a
per-thread counter is used to identify tasks, 2) threads are created
on the UI thread and given names from a global counter, 3) tasks are
replayed in the test replay in the order in which they appear in the
session record.

## Test Sequence

Run the test. Push the push button, "hello, world" should be
displayed. Push the toggle button, and then push the push button
again. "hello, world" should be displayed again after a delay of
approximately one second.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

"hello, world" should appear twice, and the delay before the second
"hello, world" should be about 1 second.
