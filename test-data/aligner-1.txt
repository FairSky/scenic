# Name: Aligner-1

## Description

The aligner widget is tested. It can align its content horizontally
and vertically. There are four options for each orientation: left,
center, stretch and right (horizontally) and top, center, stretch and
bottom (vertically). 'Stretch' means that the content fills the
aligner in the specified direction.

## Test Sequence

Run the test.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

A 4x4 grid covers the scene. There is a cell for each combination of
alignment options (4 horizontal, 4 vertical, 16 combinations). Check
that the aligned content (a button with text describing the horizontal
and vertical alignment used for the button) for each cell is aligned
correctly.
