# Name: Grid Layout Options

## Description

The scene is filled with a grid. The grid layout is specified using
grid offsets (see the code of the scene function, `grid-offset`). Some
of the cells have row spans or cell spans greater than one.

There are layout options specified for the rows and columns.

## Test Sequence

Run the test.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Check that a grid with 24 cells (6x4) appears.

The cells should be divided in four regions, corresponding to the grid
offsets. The first three regions are 2x3 regions and are layed out one
next to the other. The fourth region is 6x1 and is layed out below the
other three.

Additionally, the cell at (1,1) (counting from 0) has a row span of 2
and the cell at (1, 3) has a cell span of 3.

Check the layout options in the source of `grid-layout-options` to see
what the grid should look like.

The tests `grid-layout-options-2` and `grid-layout-options-3` are only
a little different. Check the layout options in their definition to
see what they are expected to look like.
