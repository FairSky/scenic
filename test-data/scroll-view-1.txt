# Name: Scroll-View-1

## Description

Four colored squares are placed in a scroll-view widget with attached
scrollbars.

## Test Sequence

Scroll both scrollbars to their maximum values (the square in the
lower right corner becomes completely visible).

Scroll both scrollbars back until their walkers are at the middle of
their respective possible excursions.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Check that the lower right corner is visible when scrollbars are at
maximum values. Check that all four squares are visible when the
scrollbars are at middle-excursion.
