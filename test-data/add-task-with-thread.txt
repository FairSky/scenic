# Name: Add Task With Thread

## Description

A system of tasks is used to execute UI code on the UI thread (so we
don't need to bother making all the scenic code thread safe). Since
tasks can be added from other threads, they can be added in various
orders. To make sure the test is replayed in the same order, a counter
is used to make the running order of tasks deterministic (NOTE: this
counting scheme also needs to identify threads in the 'task number',
this is not done yet - I need to allocate threads myself *on the UI
thread* so the numbering is deterministic).

## Test Sequence

Run the test. Wait for the messages "First thread done." and "Second
thread done." to appear.

## Pass/Fail Criteria
