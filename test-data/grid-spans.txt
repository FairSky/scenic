# Name: Grid Spans

## Description

The scene is filled with a grid. The grid layout is specified using
grid offsets (see the code of the scene function, `grid-offset`). Some
of the cells have row spans or cell spans greater than one.

## Test Sequence

Run the test.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Check that a grid with 24 cells (6x4) appears.

The cells should be divided in four regions, corresponding to the grid
offsets. The first three regions are 2x3 regions and are layed out one
next to the other. The fourth region is 6x1 and is layed out below the
other three.

Additionally, the cell at (1,1) (counting from 0) has a row span of 2
and the cell at (1, 3) has a cell span of 3.
