# Name: Glass-1

## Description

Test the glass widget, which displays its child with customizable
opacity.

## Test Sequence

Run the test.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

The three squares that appear near the top of the scene (red, green
and respectively blue) must look rather pale (compare to the colors in
the "Colored rectangles" test). This is because they are placed in
glass widgets with opacities less than 1.0.
