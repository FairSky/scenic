# Name: Scroll View 2

## Description

There are four scroll views widgets, each with four colored squares
inside. The upper-left scroll view needs both horizontal and vertical
scrollbars, the upper-right scroll view needs only the vertical
scrollbor, the lower-left scroll view needs only the horizontal
scrollbar, and the lower-right scroll-view needs no scrollbars.

## Test Sequence

Run the test. Scroll all scrollbars to the bottom/right of their
domain.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Check that only the necessary scrollbars are displayed.

Check that when scrollbars are scrolled to the bottom/right of their
domain the bottom-right squares appear correctly inside the associated
scrollviews (the squares are square and do not touch the bottom/right
edge of the scroll view).
