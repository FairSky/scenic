# Name: Scroll View Hittest

## Description

Buttons are placed in a scroll view, and hit-testing inside the scroll
view is tested.

## Test Sequence

Click on the buttons inside the scroll view. Click around the buttons
(close to them).

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Check that the buttons "click" correctly (which also means that
hit-testing works correctly).
