* Open Issues
** Some events don't need the :bubble/:cascade classification
   Would it be OK to use nil as the 'propagation' argument to
   add-event-handler?

* DONE layout options for boxes
** DONE add layout options
** DONE tests for layout options (separate demos for vertical and horizontal)
** DONE update other tests to use layout options
* DONE button widget (events, mouse clicks, states);
* DONE scrollbar;
** DONE slider;
*** DONE horizontal
*** DONE vertical
** DONE arrow buttons
* DONE grid layout;
** DONE first cut;
** DONE add offsets on the cell arrangement DSL;
** DONE add column and row spans;
** DONE add row and column layout options (similar to boxes);
*** DONE first cut;
*** DONE move the grid into its own package (it has many helper functions)
*** DONE write some tests for the column/row layout options
** DONE change vertical and horizontal boxes to be one dimensional grids
   decided not to do it, boxes are faster
** DONE add aligner widgets that use a grid to align their child
   added a separate aligner widget - faster
* DONE change the helper macros from scenic-macros into functions;
   redefine the package and file to 'scenic-helpers'.
* DONE rename the helper functions in :scenic-helper to sane alternatives;
* DONE min/max controls (they force the min/max width/height for their child)
* DONE clipper class
* DONE refactor the measure-* and layout-* setting
  - add separate methods for them, don't call-next-method to do it;
  - factor the duplicated code for background and clipper into
    the measure/layout for container1
* DONE opacity class
* DONE grid processing - in the same order that the controls
  appeared in the lisp source (reverse the lists at the end of
  apply-children-descriptions)
* DONE canvas class (top/left/bottom/right/width/height positioning)
  called henchman
* TODO scroll view;
** DONE first cut (no scrollbars integration)
** TODO add scrollbars (integrate them with a helper function)
** TODO scrollbars should disappear when not needed (enhance helper function)
** TODO the paint method/event should have a 'paint rect'
   argument so that we now what we need to paint; this is necessary
   for datagrids and such, so that they don't paint themselves
   completely all the time.
* TODO fix the scrollbar bug;
  When dragging, it is always assumed we are dragging the middle of
  the walker; we should drag according to the position of the mouse
  relative to the walker when the dragging started;
* TODO scrollbar bug;
  the walker should touch the right/bottom arrow if the current min
  pos + page size is max pos (maybe round the width/height up?)

  REPRO: see the scroll-view-1 test
* TODO fix the box layout bug
  (if there is not enough space, some elements are not measured; they
  should be measured with space 0)
* TODO break the events into a separate package
* TODO break the containers into a separate package
* TODO break the tests into more suites
** TODO move tests to separate folder
* TODO text box;
* TODO popups/dialogs;
* TODO menubar/menu;
* TODO combo box;
* TODO checkbox/radio box;
* TODO themes/widget factories;
* TODO unit tests (e.g. for the grid layout)
* TODO tree widget
* TODO datagrid widget
* TODO minesweeper and solitaire demos :-)
